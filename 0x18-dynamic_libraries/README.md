# C - Dynamic libraries
A new project about Dynamic libraries in __C programming language__.
## General
In this project, we were able to:
* know how does dynamic library work, how to create one, and how to use it.
* know What is the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it.
* differenciate between static and shared libraries.

## Tasks
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life.
	* Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:
1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

	* Create a script that creates a dynamic library called `liball.so` from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory.
